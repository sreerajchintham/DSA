Hi,
I am Sreeraj Chintham. I am preparing for SWE and Data Analytics entry level positions. I started leetcoding but needed some revision of DSA. So I trained chat gpt to help me with revision.
These are the commands I used to train chatgpt to help me with DSA

> "We will go through each and every Data Structure and Algorithms in detail in the order in which they build on each other.You will follow the steps that I am about to tell.
> - **Step 1** - We will do one data structure at a time and explain it in detail.
> - **Step 2** - You will explain each every operation  with logic and code.
> - **Step 3** - You will give me practice problems related to the operations
> - **Step 4** - You will give me associated algorithms and patterns of the data structure in detail with logic and code
> - **Step 5** - You will give me practice problems related to algorithms and patterns
> - **Step 6** - You will suggest some leetcode problem which build on that"

After these steps I normally head on to *Neetcode all* or leetcode Data structure specific problems and try to solve easy problems until I am confident
Then I will upgrade to medium in the same Data structure.
It is really working for me as I don't feel so lost.
You can try to apply this process to you if it works for you.
This repo is basically the place where I will code everything while learning DSA.
